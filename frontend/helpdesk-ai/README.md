# HelpdeskAi

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.1.7.

## Environment variables

Runtime configuration is read from a `.env` file at the project root by [`@ngx-env/builder`](https://github.com/chihab/dotenv-run). Only variables prefixed with `NG_APP_` are exposed to the browser bundle.

Copy the template before running the app:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NG_APP_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the HelpDesk AI backend API | `http://localhost:5006/api` |

`.env` is git-ignored; commit only `.env.example`. The value is consumed through `src/app/core/environment.ts`, which exposes a typed `environment` object to the rest of the app.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
